# Recrypted Component

These are the bindings for [Wasm Interface Types Component](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/introduction.html) so the core library can be run anywhere [`wasmtime`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) runs (Rust, JS, ...)

## Tests

[./tests/mod.rs](./tests/mod.rs) contains the Rust tests for the component, also shows how to use the component in Rust.

To run the tests:

```bash
cargo test
```
